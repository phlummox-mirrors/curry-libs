-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Library to support meta-programming in Curry.
---
--- This library contains a definition for representing Curry programs
--- in Curry (type "CurryProg") and an I/O action to read Curry programs and
--- transform them into this abstract representation (function "readCurry").
---
--- Note this defines a slightly new format for AbstractCurry
--- in comparison to the first proposal of 2003.
---
--- Assumption: an abstract Curry program is stored in file with
--- extension .acy

--- Current version of AbstractCurry
version :: String
version = "AbstractCurry 1.0"

--- A module name.
type MName = String

--- The data type for representing qualified names.
--- In AbstractCurry all names are qualified to avoid name clashes.
--- The first component is the module name and the second component the
--- unqualified name as it occurs in the source program.
type QName = (MName, String)

--- Data type to specify the visibility of various entities.
data CVisibility
  = Public    -- exported entity
  | Private   -- private entity
  deriving (Eq,Show)


--- Data type for representing a Curry module in the intermediate form.
--- A value of this data type has the form
--- 
---     (CProg modname imports typedecls functions opdecls)
--- 
--- where modname: name of this module,
---       imports: list of modules names that are imported,
---       typedecls: Type declarations
---       functions: Function declarations
---       opdecls: Operator precedence declarations
data CurryProg = CurryProg MName [MName] [CTypeDecl] [CTypeClassDecl] [CFuncDecl] [COpDecl]
  deriving (Eq,Show)

-- |This data type represents both: type class declarations and
--   type class instances. A value of this type can have the following
--   two forms
--
--  @CClassDecl className visibility superClasses typeVars methods@
--
--  where
--
--  [@className@]    Name of the declared class
--
--  [@visibility$]
--
--  [@superClasses@] List of super classes
--
--  [@typeVars@]     List of type variables
--
--  [@methods@]      List of class methods as well as default implementations;
--                    the former is represented as @CFuncDecl@ without any rules
--
--  Example: @
--            -- New type class declaration with artificial dependencies
--            class (Eq a, Enum a) => NewTypeClass a where
--              -- method with default implementation
--              identity :: a -> a
--              identity = id
--
--              -- ordinary class method
--              toggle   :: a -> a
--           @
--
--  @CInstanceDecl className contexts typeConstructor methods@
--
--  where
--
--  [@className@]       Name of the class corresponding to instance declaration
--
--  [@visibility$]
--
--  [@contexts@]        List of super classes
--
--  [@typeConstructor@] Type constructor of given instance declaration
--
--  [@methods@]         Implementation of class methods
--
--  Example: @
--            -- The NewTypeClass instance for Bool adopts the default
--                implementation for the identity method
--            instance (Eq a, Enum a) => NewTypeClass Bool where
--              toggle   x = not x
--           @

-- |Representation of a type class context for type signatures,
--   class declarations and class instances

--- Data type for representing definitions of algebraic data types

--- A data type definition of the form

---
--- is represented by the Curry term
---
---     (CType t v [i1,...,in] [...(CCons c kc v [t1,...,tkc])...])
---
--- where each `ij` is the index of the type variable `xj`.
---
--- Note: the type variable indices are unique inside each type declaration
---       and are usually numbered from 0
---
--- Thus, a data type declaration consists of the name of the data type,
--- a list of type parameters and a list of constructor declarations.

--- which is unique inside a function and n is a name (if possible,
--- the name written in the source program).

--- Data type for representing function declarations.

--- A function declaration in AbstractCurry is a term of the form
---
--- <code>(CFunc name arity visibility type (CRules eval [CRule rule1,...,rulek]))</code>
---
--- and represents the function <code>name</code> defined by the rules
--- <code>rule1,...,rulek</code>.
---
--- Note: the variable indices are unique inside each rule
---
--- Thus, a function declaration consists of the name, arity, type, and
--- a list of rules.
---
--- A function declaration with the constructor <code>CmtFunc</code>
--- is similarly to <code>CFunc</code> but has a comment
--- as an additional first argument. This comment could be used
--- by pretty printers that generate a readable Curry program
--- containing documentation comments.
