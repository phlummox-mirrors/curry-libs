--- This library defines a data structure for sequence of values.
--- It is used in search trees (module `SearchTree`) as well as in
--- set functions (module `SetFunctions`).
--- Using sequence of values (rather than standard lists of values)
--- is necessary to get the behavior of set functions
--- w.r.t. finite failures right, as described in the paper

--- A value sequence is an abstract sequence of values.
--- It also contains failure elements in order to implement the semantics
--- of set functions w.r.t. failures in the intended manner.

--- Adds a value to a sequence of values.

--- Adds a failure to a sequence of values.
